As several air booking corporates are popping up online, passengers are trying to learn how ticket pricing decesions are taken by there airline corporations and how it varies so often.
Nowadays, airline companies use complicated techniques and approaches to systematically allocate airfare prices. 
Due to the high complexity of the pricing models applied by the airlines, it is very diffcult for a customer to purchase an air ticket at the lowest price. 
Since the price changes dynamically and it is very diffcult for a person to predict it. As data scientists, the task given here is to accurately predict the flight price. 
The prediction will hrelp the passengers to decide a specific airline as per his/her budget and save his/her time and money.
